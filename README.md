# PySIEM

Obviously not a SIEM lol but this script sends you an alert when it in response to a possible brute force attack on your computer.

3 failed passwords: An email gets sent letting you know of the irregular login attempts.

5 failed passwords: A text message will be sent to your phone regarding the suspicious activity. 

Most major phone carriers have a function where you can use your email to send text messages to yourself.  
I thought it would be cool to implement it in scripts and some automation stuff.

You will need to use this for the text notification to work (but optional).
